Backend Devloper RoadMap

Ans :- Backend devloper is type of programmer who focus on creating the underlying logic and servers side software that powers of website and Applications

Primary responsibilities

Server Side Logics -> they write code that runs on web servers which handle bussiness logic of applications this includes processing user requests
                      interacting db and controlling flow data between server and the front end of website  or application.

DBMS->  Backend devloper are often responsible for designing, implementing and maintainning databases they manage and manupulate the data that stored 
        inthe db ensuring integrity and security.

API Devlopment :-> Which Allows different software Applications to communicate with each other APIS crucial for the integrations of the different System
                   and for enabling frontend Applications to access server side functions and Data.

Server Management :-> they may also be involved in configuring and managing the server  where the applications runs this can inculde setting up 
                    cloud based server managing server resources and securing uptime and performance 

Security:-> its ensuring the security of the web application is a key part of backend devloper job this includes protecting against cyber threat
            securing data and implementing authentication and authorization schemes 


Backend Programming Language
============================

Vanila JS [Node JS]

-> Asynchronous
-> Event Driven
-> Scalabel & high performance applications


Git and Github
==============

git is version control system that Allows devloper to track and manage their changes to their codebase

1) its is a software
2) its installed in a system
3) its command line tool
4) its tool manage different versions of edits made files in git repository
5) it provides functionalities like version control system source code Management


Github is a web based platform which leverages git and enables devloper to collabrate on projects review code and manage changes.

1) its a service
2) its hosted on web
3) it provides GUI
4) its space to upload a copy of git repository
5) it provides functionalities of Git like VCS, source code Management as well as adding few its own features


RDBMS
=====

Mysql,postgress,Oracle,MongoDB

API
===
REST API
GraphQL

Caching 
========
its technique to store copies of data in a temporary storage area which helps in reducing the load on the backend system decreasing latency and 
improving the performance of the web application backend devloper needs to where and how to implement caching Strategies effectively.


API Security
============
its paramount to to protect sesitive data and prevent unauthorized access backend devloper should be familiar with best practice such as implementing
authentication and authorization data encryption rate limiting and  regular security audits to safeguard the APIS.

a) Improper Asset Management
b) Code Injection
c) Excessive Data Exposure
d) Broken Object level - Function level authorization and Broken User authentication
e) Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
f) Function level authorization
g) Security Misconfiguration
h) User authentication
i) Lack of resources & rate limiting
k) Mass Assignment

Testing
=======
Unit Testing
integrations Testing
End to End Testing

Software Design and Architecture
================================

creating
----------
Scalabel
maintainable
Efficient

Design Pattren
==============
Creation
Structural
Behavioral

Message Brokers
===============
RabbitMQ
Apache Kafka

client req ---> Message Broker--->service 1
                                  service 2
                                  service 3

Containerization
===============
Docker
Kubernetes
Openshift

Nginx
=====
its popular webserver known for its high perfomance stability and Efficient resource usage backend devloper should understand
how to configure engine X to server static files proxy requests and handle load balanceing which is crucial for building Scalabel and
reliable web applications 

GraphQL
=======
its query Language for API that allows client request exactly the data need making an efficeint alternative to traditional rest APIs 
Backend devloper should understand how to implement GraphQL server to provides flexible and efficeint data access 



GraphQL Use Cases

GraphQL server with =====cloud==========>           servers
connected DB      <========cloud==============


GraphQL Layers =====cloud==========>           Legacy System, MicroServices , 3rd part APIS
that integrate  <========cloud==============
existing system 

Firebase
========
its comprenhewnsive tool for building web and mobile application includes real time databases authentication and hosting its favord for rapid 
Devlopment and its ability to scale automaticaly making it a popular choice for startups and agile projects 

Redis
======

its inmemory DS store used as a databases Caching AND Message Broker its high perfomance and support for various Data Structure such as strings 
hashes and lists make it invaluable for scenarios requring fast access to data such as caching


Infrastructure Knowledge
========================
Cloud knowledge,Containerization Orchanization ,serverless computing ,Virtual Machine, Server, Networks how interconnected deliver Applications as well as
it can significaly enhance the efficeintly and Scalabity of application


NOTE:- Backend Devloper is a constantly shifting with new technology best practice refine regular above cover with SOLID principle.
